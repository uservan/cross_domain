Then she fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. By a move, Sergey tells Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20 , and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index. How many moves does Sergey need to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}.",
